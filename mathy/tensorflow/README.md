Mathy Agent
---

This folder contains the reinforcement learning agent and training system for interacting with a MathEnvironment. It uses an architecture similar to that of AlphaGoZero which is to say it uses Monte Carlo Tree Search and a Policy/Value neural network to incrementally manipulate math expressions until they reach a desired target state.
