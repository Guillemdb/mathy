## Mathy Alpha

This agent was trained on problems of varied complexity up to 24-term polynomials on slightly more than 30,000 observations. The training took about one day on a MacBook Pro using a single-core of the computer in the background while I worked.

Initializing from this model should enable your agent to confidently solve 10 or so term polynomials with only 100 or so MCTS simulations.
