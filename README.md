The math parser and expression class hierarchies were originally based on the awesome [Silverlight Graphing Calculator](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlight/Silverlight-Graphing-fb30536e) project.

The MCTS and AlphaGo framework for the original Python version comes from [Alpha Zero General](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general)
