Mathy is a library for exploring math with machine learning.

Mathy parses and transforms math problems from arbitrary inputs into desired outputs. A simple example might be solving an addition problem: given a text input "4 + 3" mathy can evaluate and return the number 7.

It uses Reinforcement Learning (a form of machine learning) to build an understanding of how to solve math problems step-by-step without programming heuristics into the system about which rules to apply in what order.


<mathy>4 + 3</mathy>
