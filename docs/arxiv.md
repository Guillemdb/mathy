Mathematical Reasoning Machines, Interpretibility and The Problem Problem
---

In recent discussions about training intelligent machines, a controversial issue has been whether or not one should train a model end-to-end from raw input to a final output. On the one hand some argue that this helps train more clever models because they are forced to take responsibility for solving all sub-tasks involved in producing the desired output. From this perspective, model architecture and principled design are viewed as the keys to unlocking the potential of AI. On the other hand, producing
