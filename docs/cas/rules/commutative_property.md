The `Commutative Property` of numbers says that we can re-order two `addition` or `multiplication` terms such that one occurs before the other in the expression, without changing the value of the expression.

The formulation of this property is the same for addition and multiplication:

- Addition `a + b = b + a`
- Multiplication `a * b = b * a`

Examples:

- `2 + 4 = 6` and `4 + 2 = 6`
- `2x + 4x = 6x` and `4x + 2x = 6x`
- `2 * 3 * 1 = 6` and `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`

The commutative property is used for re-arranging the order of parts of an expression, and is as such very important for working with mathematical expressions.

### Transformations

Given a common parent node, this rule switches the order of the children of that node. It can only be applied to addition or multiplication nodes.

#### Addition

`a + b = b + a`

```
        +                  +
       / \                / \
      /   \     ->       /   \
     /     \            /     \
    a       b          b       a
```

#### Multiplication

`a * b = b * a`

```
        *                  *
       / \                / \
      /   \     ->       /   \
     /     \            /     \
    a       b          b       a
```
