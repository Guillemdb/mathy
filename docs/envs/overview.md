Mathy includes a framework for building [reinforcement learning](/ml/reinforcement_learning) environments that transform math expressions using a set of user-defined actions. 

There are a number of built-in environments aimed at simplifying algebra problems, and generous customization points for creating new ones.

# Overview

Mathy environments are used to encapsulate all the changes that happen to an expression from its initial state until it reaches a desired output state. The environments follow a standard reinforcement learning environment lifecycle, which looks roughly like:

 1. set **state** to an **initial state** generated by the environment
 2. **while** **state** is not **terminal**
    - take an **action** and get a new **state**
 3. **done**
