The `Distributive Property` of numbers says that we can factor out common values from terms that are connected with an addition operator. 

This rule is expressed by the equation `ab + ac = a(b + c)`

Examples:

- `9y + 9y` becomes `(9 + 9) * y`
- `14x + 7x` becomes `(14 + 7) * x`
- `7 + 7` becomes `(7 + 7) * 1`
- `6 + 4` becomes `(3 + 2) * 2`


!!! note
    This is a core transformation used in combining like terms, though we normally skip over it mentally because humans are quite smart. 

    Consider that the `9y + 9y` example from above becomes `(9 + 9) * y`. If you then apply a constant simplification rule, you end up with `18y`, which is the result of combining the two like `y` terms.


### Transformations

Given a common parent node, this rule extracts the common value from both sides, leaving an addition and a multiplication.

#### Addition

`ab + ac = a(b + c)`

```
          +               *
         / \             / \
        /   \           /   \
       /     \    ->   /     \
      *       *       a       +
     / \     / \             / \
    a   b   a   c           b   c
```
