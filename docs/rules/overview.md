Parsed MathExpression trees can be manipulated using "rules" that take an input expression and return an output tree that is equivalent to the input but stated in a different way. A basic example might switch the order of two terms separated by an addition, from "2 + 4" to "4 + 2". This change is valid because the same value is obtained by evaluating the input and output expressions.

As you may have already guessed, the base rules defined for Mathy map directly to the "Properties of Numbers" from algebra: the commutative property allows the example above, while the associative property changes the evaluation order of nodes in the tree ("4 + 2x + 3x" to "4 + (2x + 3x)" [<--check that example], and the distributive property allows factoring out common elements from nearby terms ("4x + 4x" to "(4 + 4) _ x") as well as redistributing nodes back after factoring them out ("x _ (4 +4)" to "4x + 4x").
