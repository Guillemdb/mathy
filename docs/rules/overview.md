After converting an input like `4x + 2 + 3x` into a tree we want to change it in meaningful ways, so we use a set of rules to produce transformations in the tree. The rules that Mathy implements for performing tree transformations generally map directly to the `Properties of Numbers` and obey the `Order of Operations`.
