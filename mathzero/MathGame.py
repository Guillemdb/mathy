    Implement a math solving game where players have two distinct win conditions

    the player to execute the right sequence of actions to reduce a math expression
    to its most basic representation. The second is for the other player to expand 
    the simple representations into more verbose expressions.

    Ideally a fully-trained player will be able to both simplify arbitrary mathematical
    expressions, and expand upon arbitrary parts of expressions to generate more complex
    representations that can be used to expand on concepts that a user may struggle with.
